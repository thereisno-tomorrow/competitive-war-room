COMPETITOR BEING ANALYZED:
${competitorProfile}

You are classifying ${ctx.articles.length} article(s) about ${ctx.competitorName}.
Each article is from an EVENT source (RSS feed, LinkedIn). Your job is to:
1. Group articles about the SAME real-world event together
2. Classify each distinct event
3. Omit articles that are not competitively noteworthy (omission = SKIP)

ARTICLES:
${articlesBlock}

FINMO'S POSITIONING CLAIMS:
${claimsList}

${CLASSIFICATION_RUBRIC}
${existingKeysBlock}
EVENTKEY FORMAT:
- Lowercase, hyphenated, no special chars. Aim for 3-6 segments.
- Structure: {company}-{what-happened}. Do NOT include dates, months, or years.
- Normalize verbs to domain nouns: "announces/appoints/adds/names" → "hires"; "launches/releases/unveils" → "launch"; "raises/secures" → "funding"; "acquires/buys" → "acquisition"
- Focus on WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED, not how the headline phrases it.
- Examples (different articles about the SAME event must produce the SAME key):
  "Nium Announces Three New C-Suite Hires" → "nium-c-suite-hires"
  "Nium Appointed Three C-Suite Executives (CTO, CMO, CRCO)" → "nium-c-suite-hires"
  "Kyriba Launches AI Cash Forecasting Module" → "kyriba-ai-cash-forecasting-launch"
  "Airwallex raises $300M in Series F" → "airwallex-series-f-funding"
  "Ripple Completes Acquisition of GTreasury" → "ripple-gtreasury-acquisition"

TASK: Classify these articles. Group articles about the SAME real-world event into a single event entry.
Respond with ONLY valid JSON matching this schema:
{
  "events": [
    {
      "articleIndices": number[] (indices of articles describing this event — e.g. [0, 2, 3]),
      "eventKey": string (normalized event key — IDENTICAL across runs for same event),
      "type": one of ${typeOptions},
      "summary": string (one clear factual sentence describing what happened),
      "finmoImplication": string (one sentence on why this matters to Finmo's positioning),
      "evidenceTier": "CONFIRMED" | "INFERRED" | "UNKNOWN",
      "affectedClaimIds": string[] (IDs of positioning claims affected, empty array if none),
      "sourceUrl": string (the best specific article URL from the grouped articles),
      "publishedAt": string (ISO 8601 YYYY-MM-DD or "" if unknown)
    }
  ]
}

RULES:
- If multiple articles describe the SAME real-world event, merge them into ONE event entry with all their articleIndices. Pick the best sourceUrl and most complete summary.
- Each article should appear in at most ONE event's articleIndices.
- Articles that are boilerplate, not noteworthy, or contain no competitive intelligence should NOT appear in any event — omission means SKIP.
- If ALL articles are noise, return {"events": []}.
- Pick the single most accurate type per event.
- Summary should be factual and specific (e.g. "Kyriba adds AI cash forecasting to treasury suite")
- Finmo implication should focus on competitive impact, not restate the summary
- Be conservative with evidence tier — use CONFIRMED only when the source directly states it
- Only include claim IDs that are genuinely affected by this signal
- For sourceUrl: prefer specific article/announcement links over generic landing pages
- For publishedAt: look for dates near headlines or article metadata — do NOT guess or invent dates
- eventKey must be IDENTICAL for articles about the same real-world event, regardless of which publisher wrote it`;
